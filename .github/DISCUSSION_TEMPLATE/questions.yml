        Thanks for your interest in NAVFITX!

        Please follow these instructions, fill every question, and do every step. 🙏

        Doing this helps save me a lot of time.

        By asking questions in a structured way (following this) it will be much easier to help you.

        And there's a chance that you will find the solution along the way and then you even have to submit it and wait for an answer.

        If there are too many questions, I'll have to discard and close the incomplete ones. That will allow me to focus on helping people like you that follow the whole process and help me help you.
