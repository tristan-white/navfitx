# Instructions

!!! warning

    BUPERSINST 1610.10H is the authoritative document that provides policy and procedures for the Navy Performance Evaluation System.

This section provides the basic information needed to complete performance reports and summary letters.                                              
                                                                                
1-2. Instructions for Specific Blocks. See specific chapters and report examples for exceptions
to the below instructions.                                                

## NAME

Enter the member's last name, first name, middle initial, and suffix (if any) separated by spaces. Place a comma after the last name. Omit spaces and punctuation within a name (e.g., Denney, John A; STJohn, Melvin J II; Walters, J Arthur; Obrien, Mary S; Martin, Paul T JR; SmithJones, Ann.). The full middle name is acceptable but not required. NMN may be used if member does not have a middle name.

## GRADE/RATE

Enter the grade or rate the Service member is actually wearing on the ending date of the report.

Enlisted: Use standard rate abbreviations (e.g., SA, ADAN, CS2, BM1, LNC, EMCS, PSCM, etc.).

Officers: Use standard grade abbreviations (e.g., CAPT, CDR, LCDR, LT, LTJG, ENS, CWO5, CWO4, CWO3, CWO2, WO1 etc.).

!!! note
    This field is used for summary group comparison.

!!! note
    The CHIEFEVAL identifies this block as “Rating.” Standard abbreviations remain as the required information and the rate/rating the member is currently wearing should be entered here.

## DESIG

BLOCK 3

Enter officer designator or enlisted warfare qualification designation.

Enlisted: Enter up to two enlisted warfare/qualification designators. If two designators are entered, separate with a slash. Do not leave spaces (e.g., AW, AW/PJ, SS/DV etc.) (if none,
leave blank).

Officers: Enter the four-digit officer designator as of the ending date of report. Do not use an alpha character for a numerical character.

!!! note
    This field is used for summary group comparison.

## Department of Defense (DoD) ID/SSN

BLOCK 4

Enter the Service member's full SSN with hyphens after the third and fifth digits.
It should be used for all reports that are mailed (e.g., 000-00-0000).

DUTY/COMPETITIVE STATUS

BLOCK 5 

This field is used for summary group comparison. For enlisted, group all ACT and Training and Administration of Reserves (TAR) together and group inactive duty (INACT) and annual training (AT)/active duty for operational support (ADOS) separately. For officers, do not mix summary groups. Place an X in only one box to indicate the member’s status as follows:

- ACT – All active duty (ACDU) Navy who compete together for the same active-duty promotion quotas.
- TAR – All Navy Reserve personnel designated TAR who compete for TAR promotion quotas.
- INACT – All Navy reservists on INACT duty (drill status) who compete for INACT promotion quotas (refer to chapter 9).
- AT/ADOS – All Navy Reservists on temporary ACDU but still compete for INACT promotion quotas. Includes all annual training (AT), active duty for training (ADT), active duty for ADOS, 1-year recall (OYR), canvasser recruiter (CANREC), mobilization, recall, etc. (refer to chapter 10).

## Unit ID Code (UIC)

BLOCK 6

Enter the UIC of the Service member's ship or station. Normally a UIC is a breakout for enlisted personnel; however, if reporting seniors have more than one UIC with enlisted personnel attached, but desires to group all enlisted personnel together, they may do so. If using UIC as a summary group comparison, block 6 should match the primary UIC of the reporting senior in block 26. For activities which no UIC is assigned, enter five zeros. The first four characters of a UIC must be numbers.

Reserve Members: For Regular reports on INACT duty reservists, enter the Service member’s assigned unit mobilization unit identification code (UMUIC), and not the member’s Navy

Reserve activity (NRA) UIC. Use training unit identification code (TRUIC) if member is in- assignment processing (IAP) (refer to chapter 9).

!!! note
    This field is used for summary group comparison.

## SHIP/STATION

Block 7 

Enter the abbreviated name of the activity to which the member is assigned, for the duty reported on. Do not spell out letters and numbers (e.g., use A instead of ALFA, 1 instead of ONE etc.).

Enlisted: Use the command name, even if a component UIC is entered in block 6.

Officers: Enter the activity where the officer is assigned, not the reporting senior’s command.  For Service members assigned to civilian or foreign activities, enter the civilian or foreign activity, not the administrative commander's activity. The entry may fill the space allowed, but it must be unique and recognizable within the first 18 characters and spaces (the number stored in the NAVPERSCOM data file). Format the entry as follows:

Ship: Enter the hull number followed by the name. Omit USS (e.g., DDG-90 CHAFEE).

Aviation Wing or Squadron: Enter short-form wing or squadron designation (e.g., CVW-
9, VR-58).

Staff or Shore Activity: Use the plain language address (PLA) or a commonly accepted short title. Further condense the PLA (if necessary) to make it recognizable within the first 18 positions (e.g., COMSUBDEVRON 12, COMLANTFLT NORFOLK VA, RLSO MIDLANT).

## PROMOTION STATUS

BLOCK 8 

Enter the member's promotion status on the ending date of the report period as follows:

Block 8 - Promotion Status Table

Block 8 Entry Meaning

Frocked to the grade or rate entered in block 2, but not yet Frocked regularly promoted.

Selected to a grade or rate higher than shown in block 2, but not yet frocked or regularly promoted or advanced. Enlisted personnel Selected selected for commissioning programs that would make them ineligible for the E-7 through E-9 selection boards (i.e., limited duty officer (LDO)/chief warrant officer (CWO) In-service Program) may use this promotion status. However, personnel selected to other commissioning programs (Seaman to Admiral, Medical Enlisted Commissioning Program, and Medical Service Corps In-Service Procurement Program) remain eligible for the E-7 through E-9 selection board and may not use this promotion status.\ Spot-promoted to the new paygrade entered in block 2. (Use SPOT Spot rather than SELECTED for a spot-promoted Service member who has been promoted for the next higher grade).

## PHYSICAL READINESS

BLOCK 20

!!! note
    Ensure data entered here matches data entered into the official Navy Physical Readiness Information Management System (PRIMS 2) for the cycles being referenced. Utilizing the dropdown feature (CHIEFEVAL) select the date and category for the result of each official physical fitness assessment (PFA) or combat fitness assessments (CFA) conducted in the reporting period. Document all official PFAs/CFAs in block 20 using the following format (FITREP/EVAL): PPP. This indicates the individual passed three official PFAs/CFAs during the reporting period. Do not enter spaces or slashes between the characters. Enter specific PFA cycle ID information in block 29.

Performance trait grades and recommendations must conform to the following:

a. No mandated or prohibited trait mark required in "Military Bearing"/"Professionalism" for
promotability and or retention for reporting period in which member's first or second PFA failure
occurs. COs will evaluate the Sailor’s PFA progress or lack of progress when evaluating
performance.

b. For reporting period in which a member accumulated three PFA failures in a 4-year period:

(1) Enlisted members are mandated to receive minimal marks or trait grades in “Military
Bearing/Professionalism” (CHIEFEVAL block 35 and EVAL block 36) or “Significant Problems”
and “Retention Not Recommended” (CHIEFEVAL block 48, EVAL block 45, and block 47). COs
are encouraged to document a member’s progress and initiative in attaining current physical fitness

standards in the narrative section (CHIEFEVAL block 40 or EVAL block 43) and suitability for
retention (EVAL block 47).

(2) Officers are mandated to receive minimal marks or trait grades in “Military Bearing”
(FITREP block 35) or marked for “Significant Problems” (FITREP block 42). COs are encouraged
to document members’ progress and initiative in attaining current physical fitness standards and
suitability for retention in comments section (FITREP block 41).

(c) Retention/reenlistment eligibility for enlisted members will be at the CO’s discretion.
However, if retention or reenlistment eligibility was removed, the CO may submit a special
evaluation report to restore eligibility.

Block 20 Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA)/Combat Fitness Assessment (CFA) Codes

| Code | Meaning | 
|------|---------|
| P | Overall Passed PFA/CFA. Pass both BCA and PRT/CFT <br>or<br> Failed BCA and earned an outstanding-low or above on the official PRT per Guide 1 and see Guide 5 for BCA on the CFT (see Note 2 below). |
| B | Passed BCA but was authorized non-participation in the physical readiness test (PRT)/CFT for other-than-medical waiver reasons (see code "N" for non-participation reasons). Service members who achieved the PRT incentive and are "validated" in PRIMS 2 are also required to use this code. Use of this code requires a comment in block 29 (primary/collateral/watch-standing duties) with reason for non-participation in PRT. |
| F | Overall PFA/CFA failure. Failed BCA and PRT/CFT<br>or<br> Failed BCA and did not earn an excellent-low or above on the official PRT/CFT per NAVADMIN 242-24 (see Note 2 below) |

M Medically waived from the entire PFA/CFA (BCA and PRT/CFT)\
Passed BCA or medically waived from BCA and or medically waived from one or more
W\
PRT/CFT events (not full PFA waiver)


No PFA conducted during reporting period. Non-participation in entire PFA (BCA and
PRT/CFT) due to deployment or operational assignment (Dep/Op), Individual Augmentee
Manpower Management (IAMM), Global War on Terrorism Support Assignment (GSA),
Overseas Contingency Operations Support Assignment (OSA), pregnancy, temporary
additional duty (TEMADD), or excused. (Note: BCAs must still be accomplished on all
N\
members, even if on board for less than 10 weeks or unable to participate in PRT due to
Dep or Op). Dep or Op for BCA must be approved by the immediate superior in
command (ISIC). Use of this code does not require justification in the comments on
performance block. If using this code because of pregnancy, no directed comments
should be used in the performance section.

!!! note "Note 1"

    Format for block 20 must be from oldest to most recent PFA/CFA performed during the reporting period (e.g., PBF in block 20 and PFA: 17-2/18-1/18-2 in block 29 indicates that the member passed the overall 2017 cycle two, did not participate in the PRT portion of 2018 cycle one, and failed 2018 cycle 2).

!!! note "Note 2"

    Changes to the PFA pass or fail codes are effective for the CY2025 PFA cycle and beyond per NAVADMIN 242/24. Previous pass or fail codes apply for cycles prior to CY2025. Evals and FITREPs prior to CY2025 PFA cycle should reflect previous pass/fail codes and must not be updated/corrected with the new codes outlined in the table above.

!!! note "Note 3"

    Pulldown menu on CHIEFEVAL block 20 requires date of PFA/CFA and score. If there is more than one PFA or CFA conducted during the rating period, use the most recent one in block 20 and include official documentation of other PFA or CFA in any correspondence to selection boards. Additionally, place “PFA,” date of PFA or CFA, and score as the last entry in block 29. Example: PFA 7/2025 “Excellent.” Members assigned to joint units participating in another Service’s PFA equivalent or the combat fitness assessment should indicate date of test, select “other” than specify PRIMS score in Block 29 (i.e., “USMC PFA, date, USMC Pass.”). For the CFT, annotate a CFT was completed, BCA within standards/not within standards, numbered score between 1-100 and the overall CFT score category (i.e., “CFT, WS/1-99/OH”). Additionally, if no PFA was administered during the reporting period, select “other” and annotate “no PFA conducted this reporting period” into block 29.

## BILLET SUBCATEGORY (IF ANY)

BLOCK 21 

Select or enter the billet subcategory code, if authorized, or enter “NA.” Do not leave blank. Qualifying commands may subcategorize certain members by billet type when determining summary groups. See instructions within the table to determine which commands qualify. Do not use any code that does not appear in table 1-1.

Block 21 - Billet Subcategory Entry

Standard Billet Subcategories use is optional. All Service members in each subcategory must be
summarized together. If annotated with an * below, Block 21 should match entry in Block 29.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| NA | Subcategories not used. (Should appear in most reports.) |
| Basic | Member of the basic group if subcategories are used. (e.g., training activities that BASIC subcategorize instructors and students will enter “BASIC” for administrative staff.) |
| APPROVED | Mandatory requirement to use Approved in block 21 for anyone who has an approved separation, resignation, retirement, or Fleet Reserve date. The message of intent will serve as approval for this purpose. The following is the exception: E-6, E-7, and E-8 personnel eligible for the next advancement selection board who have an approved Fleet Reserve date matching their mandated high year tenure (HYT) date. See below |
| INDIV AUG | Mandatory requirement to use “INDIV AUG” in block 21 for ACDU (including TAR) members under NAVPERSCOM Augmentation Management Division (PERS-46) orders who have been at their parent command for less than 240 days or for periods of performance less than 240 days. If the member was at the parent command for greater than or equal to 240 days of the reporting period, this billet subcategory cannot be used. Regular reporting INDIV AUG seniors must also use this billet subcategory for any Regular performance evaluations required (e.g., periodic, detachment of individual, detachment of reporting senior) with a reporting period end-date less than or equal to 180 days after a member has returned to his or her parent command from an individual augmentee (IA) assignment. The 180-day period does not apply if a member transfers to a new parent command. IA supported commands must enter “INDIV AUG” code on all concurrent performance EVAL reports. |
| CO AFLOAT | CO of ships, squadrons, or other tactical units |
| CO ASHORE | COs of shore activities |
| OIC | Officer in charge (OIC) of remote or deploying detachments |
| SEA COMP | Members of Sea Component (activities with Sea and Shore Components). Group together all Sea Component members with the same reporting senior. |
| CRF\* | Members of the career recruiter force in a recruiting command |
| CANVASSER\* | Canvassers and CANREC in a recruiting command |
| RESIDENT\* | Residents in teaching hospitals or dental centers |
| INTERN\* | Interns in teaching hospitals, dental centers, training commands, or other Government-approved internship programs |
| INSTRUCTOR | Primary duty instructors in training commands and training squadrons |
| STUDENT\* | Primary duty students in training commands and training squadrons |
| RESAC1 | INACT reservists temporarily on ACDU for 1 month or more, but less than 6 months |
| RESAC6 | INACT reservists temporarily on ACDU for 6 months or more |
| SCREENED | E7 or E8 personnel who have been screened for the next paygrade but have not yet been advanced via the Senior Enlisted Marketplace should be placed in the “Screened” billet subcategory. If they have not yet been frocked, they should be “regular” in the promotion status. If an E7 or E8 has been frocked (after the receipt of orders, OBLISERV, and successful screening relevant to the job for which they’ve been selected), they would be placed in the “frocked” category in promotion status. For screened personnel who are normally included in another billet subcategory (i.e., SPECIAL03), enter “Screened” into Block 21, and enter the normal billet subcategory into Block 29 (i.e., Block 21: SPECIAL03). These screened personnel will be grouped based upon the billet subcategory, annotated in Block 29 (e.g., all screened SPECIAL03 personnel will create an independent summary group). |
| SPECIAL01 THROUGH SPECIAL20 | Use the number authorized by Navy Personnel Command (NAVPERSCOM) Performance Evaluations Division (PERS-32) in the approval letter. Do not include a space between the word SPECIAL and the number. Be sure the reporting senior's UIC is also the UIC specified in the approval letter. Submit each batch of reports using these codes with a copy of approval letter attached via USPS. |

^^Special Billet Subcategories Must Be Approved Before Use.^^ Forward a request via the chain of command to PERS-32, including the types and numbers of billets involved, how they are to be subcategorized, approximate total in each resulting summary group, and justification. Normally, each resulting summary group should have at least five officers or eight enlisted members.  Excessive numbers of subcategories will not be approved. Approvals are not permanent and will be automatically rescinded 3 years after the date approved. Authority to utilize approvals must be updated upon the CO's PRD.

^^E-6, E-7, and E-8 personnel eligible for the next advancement selection board who have approved Fleet Reserve dates on their mandated HYT date are not authorized to use the APPROVED billet subcategory.^^

!!! note

    This field is used for summary group comparison.

## REPORTING SENIOR

BLOCK 22

Enter the last name, initials, and suffix (if any) of the reporting senior.  Place a comma after the last name (e.g., STJOHN, O F). Omit spaces and punctuation within a name. Block 22 must be the same on all reports in the batch. Be sure the name and signature match.

!!! note

    This field is used for summary group comparison.

## GRADE

BLOCK 23

Enter the reporting senior's grade.

Navy and Other Sea Service Officers: Use ADM, VADM, RADM, RDML, CAPT, CDR, LCDR, LT, LTJG, ENS, CWO5, CWO4, CWO3, CWO2, or WO1.

Army (USA), Air Force (USAF), Marine Corps (USMC), or Space Force (USSF) Officers: Use GEN, LGEN, MGEN, BGEN, COL, LTC, MAJ, CPT, 1LT, 2LT, CWO5, CWO4,\ CWO3, CWO2, or WO1.

Enlisted Reporting Seniors: Use the same rules as block 2.

Civilian Reporting Seniors: Use U.S. Federal Government civilian grade (e.g., GS15, SES4).
If the reporting senior does not have a grade designation, enter “CIV.”

Entry must be five characters or less. Do not use hyphens. Do not leave blank.

!!! note

    Reservists who submit reports as civilians must use their civilian vice military grade.

## DESIG

BLOCK 24

Enter reporting senior's four-digit officer designator. Exceptions: If an assigned reporting senior is enclosing a letter report, enter “LTR” (see chapter 7). If the reporting senior is a member of another Service, enter abbreviation for branch of Service (e.g., USAF, USA, USMC, USCG, USSF, U.S. Public Health Service (USPH), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)). If the reporting senior is Navy enlisted or civilian, leave blank.

## TITLE

BLOCK 25 

Enter the reporting senior’s title (abbreviated if necessary). The entry may be up to 14 characters and spaces. Always use “CO” for commanding officer (CO) and “OIC” for officer in charge. For other titles, use the complete title or a common abbreviation (e.g., commander, XO, Dept. Head, DCNO etc.).

Delegated Reporting Senior: Indicate the level of delegation rather than function (e.g., XO vice ACTING CO, DEPT HEAD rather than SUPPLY OFFICER). DIRECTOR, standing alone, may be used only as a command title. Delegated reporting seniors use DEPT DIRECTOR, DIV DIRECTOR, etc., to indicate the level of delegation. Refer to chapter 2 for delegated reporting- senior authority.

Exception for Assigned Reporting Seniors, Immediate Superiors in Command or their Designee,
or General Courts-Martial Convening Authorities (GCMCA): Enter “Assigned,” “ISIC,” “ISIC
Designee,” or “GCMCA.” (Provide command’s title in EVAL block 48 or FITREP block 44.)

## UIC

BLOCK 26 

Enter the UIC of the reporting senior's command. All reports from the same command must use the same reporting senior UIC (i.e., a delegated reporting senior must enter the same UIC used on reports submitted by the CO).

!!! note

    Reporting senior UIC may vary from member’s UIC in block 6.

## SSN

BLOCK 27 

Enter the reporting senior's full SSN with hyphens after the third and fifth digits (e.g., 000-00-0000).

It is optional for reporting seniors to provide a copy of a report without their SSN to the member and on the command files. It is required that all efforts to properly protect and secure any PII that may be recorded within these reports, whether physical or electronic, be observed and enacted. The copy for filing to the member’s OMPF must have the reporting senior’s full SSN to track the reporting senior’s cumulative average. Throughout this process, administrative handling, security, and protection of the member’s SSN, whether physical or electronic, will be of paramount importance to prevent mishandling, loss, or sharing of the SSN with those who do not have a need to know.

!!! note

    After a report has been accepted to the OMPF, the correction of an incorrect reporting senior’s SSN requires the submission of supplemental material from the reporting senior whose name appears in Block 22. For specific directions concerning supplementary material, refer to chapter 15.

## COMMAND EMPLOYMENT AND COMMAND ACHIEVEMENTS

BLOCK 28 

Enter a brief statement of command employment and significant command awards or achievements during the period of the report. Provide information that will help report users understand the context in which the member's duties were performed. Use the following guidelines for command employment:

Operating Forces: Operational, training, and maintenance periods, including general areas and
months (unclassified only) (e.g., upkeep/Training-8; Deployed WESTPAC-3).

Shore Activities: In smaller commands, briefly state the command mission. In larger commands, identify the member's department or division and summarize its function.  Example of Command Mission: Manage Navy personnel policies and functions.

Example of Department or Division Function: NAVPERSCOM (PERS-32), Administer Navy Performance Evaluation System; processes 700,000 FITREPs, CHIEFEVALs, and EVALs per year and supports all selection boards.

Reserve Units: Indicate the unit's ACDU gaining command (i.e., active unit identification code (AUIC)) and contributory support functions (as applicable).

Assessments or Inspections (CHIEFEVAL-Specific): If a command undergoes an assessment or inspection during the rating period and is referenced in this block, the score must be included if the member contributed to the result. For example: “Supply Management Inspection (SMI)- Outstanding.” Supply ratings must include the SMI reference, whereas Engineering ratings may not, unless directly involved. Classified inspection results should not be included. Inspections that can be considered comprehensive to the command (INSURV) should be included, unless results have been deemed classified.

## PRIMARY/COLLATERAL/WATCHSTANDING DUTIES/PFA

BLOCK 29 

Enter an abbreviation of 14 or fewer characters and spaces for the most significant primary duty for the period reported on. Enter text in the small box to the right of the caption. Refer to Block 21. Block 29 should match Block 21 in some circumstances. The remainder of Block 29 consists of one to four elements, as follows:

1. Duty Titles: Beginning to the right of the abbreviation box, enter duty titles and number of months each duty was assigned during this report period. Enter duty titles in the following order: Most significant primary duty (corresponds to the abbreviation), other primary duties, collateral duties, and then watch-standing duties (e.g., COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER-7; ASST COMM-3; MESS TREASURER-8; OOD UNDERWAY-3).

2. Job Scope Statement: Briefly state the scope of primary duty responsibilities. Include such items as technical or professional duties, personnel supervised, and budget administered. Job-scope statements are optional for operational billets (e.g., responsible for base maintenance, supervising 15 military and 65 civilians, and managing $5 million).

3. Periods Not Available for Duty: Identify any periods no duties were assigned. Such periods may include enroute time prior to reporting, TEMADD, unusually long leave, etc. (Note-parental leave is identified as “Leave” and need not be specified) (e.g., TEMADD: 21OCT18-21NOV30; LEAVE/TRANSIT: 21JUN18-21JUL30).

4. PFA/CFA: Annotate the PFA/CFA cycle results as reflected in PRIMS: cycle, overall pass/fail, BCA within standards/not within standards, numbered PRT/CFT score, and overall PRT/CFT score category. Example: For a FY26 cycle 1 PFA/CFA: passed overall PFA/CFA, within BCA standards, scored a 95 on the PRT/CFT, and an overall score category of outstanding high will reflect “26-1: P/WS/95/OH”

Specific to CHIEFEVAL: Qualification and watch-standing progress reporting should/can be
abbreviated as Q (qualified), P (progressing), R (remedial, or DNQ (delinquent). These
qualifications or watches refer to those that are mandatory based on rating or position.

!!! note

    See Chapter 18 for guidance on performing mid-term counseling.\

## DATE COUNSELED

BLOCK 30 

If mid-term counseling was received during the report period, enter the date counseled from the counseling worksheet. Date may be selected from the drop-down calendar or recorded in YYMMMDD format (e.g., 22FEB20).

Counseling Not Performed During Report Period: A mid-term counseling session should be documented only once on the report for the period in which it occurred. If counseling was not performed because the counseling date did not fall within the report period, enter “NOT REQ” in block 30. If counseling was not performed for any other reason, enter “NOT PERF.”

!!! note

    See Chapter 18 for guidance on performing mid-term counseling.

## COUNSELOR

BLOCK 31

This block is signed on the counseling worksheet only. On the fitness or evaluation report, type the name of the counselor from the counseling worksheet. If the entry in block 30 is NOT PERF, enter a brief explanation in block 31 (e.g., TEMADD or ILLNESS). If a longer explanation is needed, enter “SEE COMMENT” and provide an explanation in the Comments block.

## SIGNATURE OF INDIVIDUAL COUNSELED

BLOCK 32

To reduce the number of signatures required and possible rejection issues, there is no requirement to sign block 32; it should be left blank. The signature of the reporting senior (Blocks 45 or 50) and the individual evaluated (Blocks 46, 49 or 51) verifies Blocks 30 and 31 are accurate but does not mean that the counseling was considered adequate. An individual who believes the counseling was inadequate may submit a statement to the record.

## PERFORMANCE TRAITS

BLOCKS 33-39 

Every Service member is accountable on each evaluation or FITREP for contributions to command or organizational climate/equal opportunity, military bearing, and character. To achieve high marks in these areas, members must demonstrate how they have cultivated or maintained command climates where improper discrimination of any kind is not tolerated, where all hands are treated with dignity and respect and professionalism is the norm.

For each trait, select from the dropdown (CHIEFEVAL) or place an “X” (FITREP/EVAL) in only one box. The meanings of the trait grades are printed on FITREP and EVAL form along with representative performance standards. For CHIEFEVAL, each grade has language automatically inserted describing what is required for 1.0 -5.0; three bullets (2 lines each) for amplifying remarks, justifying or explaining grade given. Grade NOB if there has not been enough observation to grade with confidence. Reporting seniors are not required to fill every line in comment blocks.

^^Command or Organizational Climate/Equal Opportunity (paygrades E1 – E6 and W1 through O6) and Accountability (paygrades E7 – E9):^^ For COs, indicate extent to which they have or have not established a command climate where allegations of sexual assault are properly managed and fairly evaluated and a victim of criminal activity, including sexual assault, can report the criminal activity without fear of retaliation, including ostracism and group pressure from other members of the command. In reports on COs, executive officers, CMDCMs, department heads, division officers, CPOs, and leading petty officers who are responsible for officer and enlisted personnel, comment on efforts by the member and quality of results in fostering a command and workplace environment conducive to growth and development of personnel. Transparency, sensitivity, and responsiveness to concerns are hallmarks of superior performance in this area. Consider member's contribution to personnel advancement, increased educational opportunities, overall career development, and results of retention excellence award programs. Where appropriate, comment on successful retention of quality members and member’s contributions toward the personal and professional development and fair treatment of assigned personnel. Marks in this block include an evaluation of contributions to the CNO's retention and attrition goals. A 4.0 mark will document above-average contribution toward achieving these goals in addition to equal opportunity and command and community involvement. A 5.0 mark will recognize exceptional performance in improving achievement of the CNO’s leadership in equal opportunity and community involvement in activities benefiting Navy personnel and their families.

Military Bearing and Character (FITREP/EVAL) and Professionalism (CHIEFEVAL): Do not grade 5.0 unless the member meets all 5.0 standards for this trait. Strict adherence of every member to the highest personal and professional standards of conduct is paramount in assessing military bearing and character. This performance trait also encompasses standards of physical appearance, fitness, and readiness. To merit high marks, a member must meet and model the highest standards of professionalism in demeanor, deportment, and interaction with, and treatment of, superiors, peers, and subordinates.

All members are personally responsible for their individual readiness including medical, dental, mental, physical, financial, and family care. As a result, anytime a member willfully becomes non- deployable (i.e., non-compliant-issue related to medical or dental treatment or administrative measures preventing deployment) or willfully incurs an individual medical readiness (IMR) deficit, it is considered a fitness/performance factor when evaluating individual readiness. Accordingly, reporting seniors must document willful non-deployability/IMR-deficit per reference (c), MILPERSMAN 1610-015 and consider it as a substantial failure in military bearing, character, and professionalism when grading this trait.

## INDIVIDUAL TRAIT AVERAGE

Enter the average of the trait grades for this report.

(Shown as “Member Trait” on CHIEFEVAL.)

## CAREER RECOMMENDATIONS

Enter one or two career recommendations. The second recommendation is not required. Each entry may have a maximum of 20 characters and spaces. If necessary, use two lines for the entry. Do not leave blank. If no recommendation is appropriate, enter “NA” or “NONE” in the first block. These are the reporting senior's recommendations, based on performance.  They are not binding on detailers; do not preclude consideration for other opportunities or replace duty preference cards. Be realistic. Do not recommend for programs or assignments that the member is not or cannot become qualified for. Be specific. The instructions on the form give examples of areas to be considered, not necessarily the specific entries desired. For officers, the first recommendation should be for their next significant career milestone.

## SIGNATURE OF RATER

Type the last name, initials, and grade or rate of the rater and obtain the wet signature. If the signature is unobtainable, see chapter 14-2b.

## SUMMARY RANKING

Every member’s ranking (hard breakout) within their competitive group must be displayed here. Regular, frocked, selected from block 8 or approved or screened from Block 21. Sailors screened for the next paygrade through the Senior Enlisted Marketplace, but not yet frocked or advanced, must be separated from members in an advanced (paid) status at
current paygrade.

## COMMENTS ON PERFORMANCE

See chapter 13 for specific guidance on preparation, organization, style, reporting on misconduct, prohibited comments, and special interest items (e.g., Get Real Get Better behaviors (GRGB)) that 40 must be mentioned when they apply.

## QUALIFICATIONS/ACHIEVEMENTS

Enter courses and credit hours completed, degrees or certificates awarded, special Navy or other qualifications attained or renewed, personal awards or letters of commendations received, other special honors or recognition received, and or community involvement. This block is reserved for completed not anticipated achievements. Do not repeat information from earlier reports. For E-7 through O-6 members, use FITREP block 41 or CHIEFEVAL block 40 for qualifications and achievements.

## INDIVIDUAL (PROMOTION RECOMMENDATION)                  

Select an option or place an “X” in the box for the promotion IFITREP/CHIEFEVALI recommendation. The recommendation may be NOB if\ BLOCK 48 appropriate (e.g., short period and no more than three trait grades are entered.) Ensure justification is provided in the comments section if a partially-graded NOB report is issued.

Promotable, Must Promote, and Early Promote are all recommendations for promotion. The recommendation should be consistent with the performance trait grades and consistent with comments block(s). Additionally, the recommendation may also consider the difficulty of the assignment and the reporting senior's judgment of the member's likely value to the Navy in the next higher grade. A promotion recommendation should not be withheld until completion of time-in-grade or other administrative requirements. For enlisted performance mark average, see chapter 16 for details. A Promotable promotion recommendation allows up to two traits, excluding Character or Equal Opportunity to be assessed as Progressing (2.0) and still maintain an overall evaluation and promotion recommendation of Promotable. This means a member who receives one or two 2.0 trait grades cannot receive a promotion recommendation higher than Promotable. Command or Organizational Climate and Equal Opportunity (FITREP/EVAL) and Accountability (CHIEFEVAL) must be evaluated as 3.0 or higher to maintain eligibility for advancement and receive a recommendation of Promotable. A recommendation of Must Promote or Early Promote may not be assigned with any trait assessed as 2.0. A Promotable or higher recommendation may not be assigned with any trait graded 1.0.

!!! note "Note 1"

    Per reference (d), enlisted members who receive any 1.0 trait grade lose eligibility for the Navy Good Conduct Medal and must reestablish a new 3-year period following the end-date of the report.

!!! note "Note 2"

    Ensign and lieutenant junior grade FITREPs for designators, other than LDO (6XXX), are prohibited from receiving a promotion recommendation higher than Promotable.  Progressingmeans the Service member is making progress but is not ready to be recommended for promotion. For enlisted personnel, do not mark Progressing if an individual has received

Promotable, Must Promote, or Early Promote on the most recent CHIEFEVAL or EVAL in the current grade. Once recommended for promotion, a reporting senior must first withdraw the promotion recommendation for enlisted personnel by submitting a Significant Problems EVAL or CHIEFEVAL. When the individual’s performance has improved sufficiently, the reporting senior may then mark the EVAL or CHIEFEVAL recommendation as Progressing or assign a promotion recommendation of Promotable, Must Promote, or Early Promote.

Significant Problems is a recommendation against promotion and must be justified in the comments. This withdraws an advancement recommendation previously in effect. For E-7 and above, a mark of Significant Problems is also a recommendation against retention, unless specifically recommended for retention in the comments. For E-6 and below, use EVAL block 47 for the retention recommendation. Refer to chapter 2 for information concerning who is authorized to sign a report that withdraws a member’s advancement recommendation after notification of selection has been made.

### Upper Limits on EP and MP Recommendations:

**Early Promote (all paygrades except non-LDO O-1 and O-2. See note 2 above):** 

- Twenty percent of each summary group (rounded up to nearest whole number).

**Early Promote and Must Promote Combined (percent of summary group, rounded up to nearest whole number):**

| Rank | Limit |
|-|-|
| E1-E4 | No limit |
| E5-E6 | 60% |
| E7-E9 | 50% |
| W1-W2 | No limit |
| W3-W5 | 50% |
| LDO O1-O2 | No limit |
| O3 | 60% |
| O4 | 50% |
| O5-O6 | 40% |

For summary groups of 30 or less, use table 1-2 on the following page.

For summary groups of more than 30 members, calculate the maximums using the following

example: Assume 42 E-6s in a summary group, 60 percent maximum Early Promote and Must
Promote combined:

Early Promote + Must Promote Maximum = 42 x 0.6 = 25.2, which = 26 (rounded up).

Early Promote Maximum = 42 x 0.2 = 8.4 = 9 (rounded up).

Must Promote Maximum = 26 – 9 = 17.

!!! note

    The Must Promote maximum is the difference between the rounded numbers. Must Promote recommendations may be increased by one for each Early Promote quota not used. All summary groups of two can receive one Early Promote and one Must Promote.

### Maximum Limits on "Early Promote" and "Must Promote" Recommendations

![EP and MP Max limits](#)

Note 2. For E-7 through E-9, W-3, W-4, W-5, and O-4 the Must Promote maximum declines by
1 for groups of 6, 16, 26, etc. due to arithmetical transfer of a quota to the Early Promote column.
Total Early Promote/Must Promote quotas remain at 50 percent.

Select or place an “X” in Not Recommended or Recommended.  Recommended means that the reporting senior recommends reenlistment or extension based on performance but does not certify that all reenlistment requirements have been met. If the report contains any adverse mark or comment, briefly explain the retention recommendation in block 43 in the context of the adverse matter.

!!! note

    For officers and CPOs, a retention recommendation will be assumed unless the report is adverse.

If the reporting senior is a rear admiral (O-7) selectee and the report is on a captain in the same competitive category, add “RDML(S)” following the signature. This verifies a flag officer endorsement is not required. If the signature is unobtainable, see chapter 14.

## SIGNATURE OF INDIVIDUAL EVALUATED                      

### Review

Give the Service members an opportunity to review their reports. Have the members verify their name, SSN, and other administrative entries. Discuss member's performance with them. Explain any adverse matter. Verbal explanation is sufficient, but the form in exhibit 14-1 may be used to notify the member in writing if desired.

### Signature

After reviewing the report, the Service members will check the box indicating their intention to submit or not to submit a statement and wet-sign and date all copies. The member's signature does not imply agreement with the report but merely certifies the member has seen the report and understands his or her right to submit a statement. In general, the member's signature is required on all Regular reports for all paygrades. Exceptions for certain types of reports and reporting situations are found in the chapters devoted to those reports. If the members cannot or do not sign a report that requires their signature, see chapter 14.

### Statement

The Service member may submit a statement on any report, whether or not the reporting senior considers it adverse. If the member desires to submit a statement, refer to chapter 17.

Member Not Available to Sign a Non-adverse Report. If the Service member is not expected to
return to or visit the command within 15 days ACDU or 30 days (INACT duty) and the report is
not adverse, the reporting senior will enter “Certified Copy Provided” in the signature block of
the member. That signifies the member will be provided a copy of the report by some means.
“Unsigned Advance Copy” is not authorized.

Member not available or refuses to sign adverse report. Refer to chapter 14.

## REGULAR REPORTING SENIOR SIGNATURE ON CONCURRENT REPORT

Concurrent and Concurrent/Regular reports must be forwarded to the member's regular reporting senior for signature. Type the CHIEFEVAL name, rank, title, and command of the regular reporting senior. The regular reporting senior will wet-sign using blue or black ink and date the report. To convert the report to Concurrent/Regular, also select or place an “X” in block 17. A report may not be endorsed as Concurrent/Regular unless it maintains Regular report continuity, see chapter 4.  1-3. Preparing the Summary Letter. Each summary group must be mailed with a summary letter, even if the summary group consists of only one report. See exhibit 1-7 for the summary letter format. Summary letters for Not Observed reports will be identified by “NOB” in the Trait Average column and the promotion recommendation breakout will be blank. The summary letter must be prepared and wet-signed using black or blue-black ink on a preprinted NAVPERS 1610/1 FITREP/EVAL Summary Letter and mailed.

!!! note

    Summary letters are required for all reports and must be signed using blue or black ink.

1-4. Submission/Mailing Procedures. All reports must be submitted within 15 days of the
ending date for active-duty members and within 30 days for INACT members. Summary groups
must include the wet-signed summary letter and all original reports.

a. Mailing to NAVPERSCOM

(1) Mail the reports and summary letters flat in a standard 9" x 12" envelope. Do not
separate the summary group. Mail all reports in a summary group in one package. Do not use
security wrappings, unless a classified supplement is enclosed (see below). More than one

summary group may be enclosed in each envelope. Special mailing (i.e., certified or registered
mail) is not required.

(2) When mailing 25 or more hard-copy FITREPs or evaluations containing PII, the
package must be double wrapped and the inner package marked "Controlled Unclassified
Information (CUI). Any misuse or unauthorized disclosure may result in both civil and criminal
penalties.” Additionally, SF901 Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Cover Sheet must be
inserted inside the outer wrapping. All such packages must be tracked with Government or
commercial delivery services.

(3) If a member is not available for signature, do not delay the entire summary group.
The reporting senior should clearly enter in the member’s signature block “Certified Copy
Provided” (excluding adverse reports) and forward the entire summary group to PERS-32.
Ensure the member is provided a copy by some means. Information concerning adverse reports
and signature requirements is found in chapter 14.

in the same summary group have the same via addressee, forward advance copies of entire
summary group(s) directly to PERS-32 in conjunction with mailing the reports for the required
countersignature and or endorsement. Retain a reproduced copy in case the originals are lost or
misplaced. The via addressee(s), after completing their action, will forward the entire summary
group to PERS-32 and forward a reproduced copy of the countersigned reports back to the
originator. If the reports do not have the same via addressee, then the concurrent reporting senior
will forward advance copies of entire summary group(s) directly to PERS-32 in conjunction with
forwarding the original report(s) to the regular reporting seniors for countersignature. The
regular reporting senior must sign and return the original report to PERS-32 for action and
provide a copy to the concurrent reporting senior.
