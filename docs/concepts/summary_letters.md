# Summary Letters

!!! note
    NAVFITX currently does generate summary letters, though this feature is coming soon.

When reports are submitted to NAVPERSCOM, each summary group is required to be submitted with a [summary letter](https://github.com/tristan-white/navfitx/blob/main/navfitx/data/blank_summary.pdf) (even if the summary group consists of only one report).

As the name implies, summary letters contains a summary of reports in a summary group (a blank summary letter can be viewed [here](https://github.com/tristan-white/navfitx/blob/main/navfitx/data/blank_summary.pdf)).

Summary letters for Not Observed reports will be identified by “NOB” in the Trait Average column and the promotion recommendation breakout will be blank. The summary letter must be prepared and wet-signed using black or blue-black ink on a preprinted NAVPERS 1610/1 FITREP/EVAL Summary Letter and mailed.

!!! warning 
    EVALMAN requires that summary letters signed using blue or black ink; digital signatures are not authorized.
