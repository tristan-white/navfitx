    All information in this section is derived from EVALMAN in [BUPERSINST 1610.10](https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Reference/Instructions/BUPERS/BUPERSINST%201610.10.pdf?ver=g42WV7fkucvkkZolLrWseA%3d%3d) which alone is the authority for Navy Performance Evaluation System policy and procedures.

There are immense number of rules that govern what makes a "valid" report. These rules are comprehensively covered in 171 page document called [BUPERSINST 1610.10](https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Reference/Instructions/BUPERS/BUPERSINST%201610.10.pdf?ver=g42WV7fkucvkkZolLrWseA%3d%3d).

NAVFIT98 comes with *some* validation logic to tell a user if a report is "valid"; the problem is there are many cases that it does not cover.

One of the primary goals of NAVFITX to validate reports against every rule in [BUPERSINST 1610.10](https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Reference/Instructions/BUPERS/BUPERSINST%201610.10.pdf?ver=g42WV7fkucvkkZolLrWseA%3d%3d) so that sailors don't need to read a 171 page manual, nor a [21 page FAQs document](https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Career/PerformanceEvaluation/NAVFIT98A%20v2.2.0.33%20Frequently%20Asked%20Question.pdf?ver=Pq4XBG6bInsRrIVtAVSPbQ%3d%3d) in order to quickly complete a common administrative task.
