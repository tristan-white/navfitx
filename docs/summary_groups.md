# Summary Groups

## What are Promotion Recommendation Summary Groups?

Enlisted summary groups generally consist of all Service members in the **same paygrade** (regardless of rating) and **same promotion status** who receive the **same type of report** from the **same reporting senior**, on the **same ending date**. The unit identification code is also a breakout for enlisted summary groups. Officer summary groups are similar but are further subdivided by competitive category (unrestricted line officers, limited duty officers (LDO), each designator within the restricted line, and each designator within the Staff Corps). Certain other criteria also apply, as detailed in the EVALMAN, chapter 1, instructions for the summary group block. Each group of reports must be mailed to PERS-32 with a summary letter marked “Controlled Unclassified Information,” which includes the names, SSNs or DoD identifications (ID), member trait averages, summary group average, and distribution of promotion recommendations for that group. It is mandatory to verify or handwrite the reporting senior’s e-mail address and telephone number on the bottom of the summary letter in the blocks provided. If there is an error on a report in a batch, it will help PERS-32 to expedite corrections.[^1]
