# Guidance for Signatures                              

!!! warning

    BUPERSINST 1610.10H is the authoritative document that provides policy and procedures for the Navy Performance Evaluation System.
                                                                                    
## Purpose

This chapter provides procedures to follow when required signatures are difficult or impossible to obtain. All reports will be submitted via mail with a wet-signature using blue or black ink only.                                                           

## Rater and Senior Rater Signatures                                   

a. Rater or Senior Rater Unavailable to Sign. Type or select the alternative signature reason (e.g., “Detached,” “Deployed,” “Leave,” or a similar phrase in the signature block). The report will be accepted without the signature.                                   

b. No Rater or Senior Rater Available. If no one is available to serve as rater or senior rater, type or select “None Available” in place of a signature. When only one person is available, that person should sign as the rater, rather than senior rater. The same person may not sign two or more blocks.                                                              

c. Rater or Senior Rater Fails to Sign. The rater, senior rater, and reporting senior are expected to reach overall agreement. In the unusual situation where a reporting senior does not agree with the trait grades or related comments assigned by either the rater or senior rater and consensus cannot be reached, the evaluation will reflect the reporting senior's decision. On the finished report, select or type "Refused to sign" in the signature blocks for either the rater, senior rater, or both, whichever may be the case. Neither the rater nor senior rater may submit a report separate from the reporting senior. The rater and senior rater may not endorse a statement submitted by the member.                                                  
## Reporting Senior Signature

Reporting seniors must personally sign each report on which their name appears. In addition, the reporting senior will include the member's trait average (FITREP and CHIEFEVAL only) and summary group average next to the line identifier in block 50 (EVAL/CHIEFEVAL) and block 45 (FITREP). This information is provided to the members so they are aware of their standing within the group being evaluated at that time. Guidelines are in chapter 2.                                              

## Member Signature

A member’s signature is desired on all reports and is required on most Regular reports. For exceptions, see the chapters devoted to specific reporting situations. Use the following guidance when a signature is required but difficult or impossible to obtain.

### Member on Leave, Assigned TEMADD, or Remotely Assigned

If the Service member is not expected to return to or visit the command within 15 days (ACDU) or 30 days (INACT) and the report is not adverse, the reporting senior should select the alternate signature or enter “Certified Copy Provided” in the member's signature block and submit the report to PERS-32.  Forward a copy to the member's current address. This copy becomes the official copy filed in the member’s OMPF. A wet-signed copy from the member is not required and PERS-32 will not remove the certified copy from the member’s official military personnel file (OMPF) and replace it with a signed copy.                                                    

### Member Transferred Before Report is Signed

A reporting senior should complete the report and obtain a signature before the member leaves the command. If the member has left the command, use the following procedures:

1. E-1 to E-4. The reporting senior must sign and date all copies. Retain the command copy and send all other copies to the member's new command under a cover letter (see exhibit 14-2). If the member submits a statement, the receiving command will forward the statement to the reporting senior to be endorsed and returned. The option to use “Certified Copy Provided” in the signature block is authorized by the detaching command if the report is not adverse.
2. E-5 to E-9                                                       
    1. Report Not Adverse. The reporting senior must sign and date all copies and select the alternative signature or write “Certified Copy Provided” in the member's signature block and submit the report to PERS-32. Send the member’s copy to the member's new command under a cover letter (see exhibit 14-2).                                          
    2. Report Adverse. The reporting senior must sign and date all copies. Mail an advance copy to PERS-32 with its summary group (see chapter 1). Retain the command copy and send all other copies to the member's new command under a cover letter (see exhibit 14-2).  The receiving command will obtain the signature and return the reporting senior and NAVPERSCOM  copies to the originating command. If the member submits a statement, also return the statement to the reporting senior for endorsement and forwarding to PERS-32.
3. Officers                                                         
    1. Report Not Adverse. The reporting senior must sign and date all copies and select or enter “Certified Copy Provided” in the member's signature block and submit the report to PERS-32. Send the member’s copy to the member’s new address.              
    2. Report Adverse. The reporting senior must sign and date the member's copy only.  Make three extra copies, retain two, and mail the other as an advance copy to PERS-32 with its summary group (see chapter 1). Mail the NAVPERSCOM’s copy, member’s copy, and reporting senior’s copy to the officer with a stamped return envelope. Direct the officer to sign and return NAVPERSCOM’s copy and the reporting senior’s copy within 10 calendar days.  Explain the procedures for preparing a statement and enclose a copy of the instructions in chapter 17 concerning statements. Upon return of NAVPERSCOM’s copy and the reporting senior’s copy, the reporting senior will sign and date the NAVPERSCOM copy (using the original signature date) and forward the report to PERS-32.           

### Member Separated

1. Report Not Adverse. Do not attempt to obtain the signature of a separated member who has already departed the area. Select the alternative signature or enter "Separated" and the
date separated. Send a copy to the member's home address.                 

2. Report Adverse. Attempt to obtain a signature by mail. The reporting senior will
sign the member's copy and a reproduced record copy. Mail these copies to the member's home
address. Explain the adverse matter, the right to make a statement, and direct the member to sign
and return the reproduced record copy with a statement, if desired. (See exhibit 14-3 for the
cover letter.) When the member returns the report, send the original copy to PERS-32.

### Procedures When Member's Signature Is Not Obtained.

If actions to obtain the member's signature have been unsuccessful, close out the report as follows:        

1. Report Forwarded for Signature and Not Returned. Initiate tracer action after 15 days. If no response has been received after an additional 15 days, forward a copy of the report to PERS-32, noting that no reply was received. Select the alternative signature or enter in the signature block "Transferred – no response to tracer."

2. Member Fails or Refuses to Sign. If member is missing, deployed on a strategic deterrent patrol, in an unauthorized absence status, deserter status, etc. and cannot sign or refuses to sign, enter an explanatory phrase in the signature block. Forward the report to PERS-32. Provide a copy of the letter to the member. If an enlisted member has refused to sign, complete NAVPERS 1070/613 Administrative Remarks (using electronic service record) entry witnessed by the reporting senior and submit to the member’s OMPF.
