List of bugs and missing features which are remediated by NAVFITX:

- "WARNING: After importing a folder or report you must open a report first before printing the summary letter to ensure the breakout summary line correctly calculate"[^1]
- NAVFIT98 requires reports be manually sorted into summary groups:
    - "WARNING: DO NOT create reports under the Root folder. Always create separate folders and
subfolders for your reports based on summary groups."[^1]
    - This is error prone because there are many variables that determine whther a sailor is in a summary group. NAVFITX automatically sorts reports into individual summary groups.
