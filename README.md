This can be done in three simple steps:

1. Copy/paste the command to install uv into powershell (if on Windows) or Terminal (if on MacOS or linux):
   - Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
   - MacOS or linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2. After uv finishes installing, close Powershell/Terminal, then reopen it.
3. Run the following command to install and launch NAVFITX: `uvx navfitx`

Done!

## Help NAVFITX Succeed

### Feedback/Suggestions
If you find a bug, have a question, or have feedback/a request for an enhancement, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/tristan-white/navfitx/issues) to track it.

I'd like to see NAVFITX replace NAFIT98A in the fleet. I'm looking for user testimonials from anyone that's used NAVFIT98A or eNavFit in order to answer the "why is this important" when I make the pitch to current NAVFIT98 stakeholders within the Navy. If you have feedback on these programs, please provide it here:

- [Provide feedback on NAVFIT98A](https://github.com/tristan-white/navfitx/discussions/1)
- [Provide feedback on eNavFit](https://github.com/tristan-white/navfitx/discussions/2) (if you had the chance to use it before it was shut down)
