NAVFITX is an next-gen NAVFIT application built to supercede NAVFIT98A.

## What is NAVFIT98A?

NAVFIT98A is Windows platform desktop application written in Visual Basic in 1998. It's purpose is to generate PDF performance evaluation reports. Every service member in the Navy gets a performance eval annually.

A brief history:

- 1998 – Birth of NAVFIT98
    - NAVFIT98 was originally developed in **1998** to automate the performance evaluation process for sailors.
    - It "replaced"[^1] paper-based forms with a Windows-based software for generating FitReps and Evals
    - Early versions were rudimentary, but it **standardized the Navy’s evaluation process** for officers and enlisted personnel.
- Early 2000s – Adoption and Core Features
    - NAVFIT98 became the **default evaluation tool** for the Navy, widely deployed across shore commands and ships.
- 2005–2010 – Integration & Upscaling
    - It was distribution-standard for the NMCI environment, designated as a **NMCI Core Application (CA)**.
    - Despite its age, it continued with relatively few feature additions, maintaining its basic design and reliance on Microsoft Access databases.
- 2010s – Persistent Use and Frustration
    - Despite the rise of electronic solutions and cloud-based software, NAVFIT98 continued unchanged, becoming a symbol of “legacy IT” in the Navy.
    - Personnel often complained about its clunky interface, single-workstation constraints, and manual distribution process, even years after better technologies existed.
- 2018 – [20 Years of NAVFIT98!](https://blog.usni.org/posts/2018/10/11/happy-anniversary-navfit98)
    - Despite widespread calls for modernization, NAVFIT98 remained central to naval personnel management.
- 2022 – Introduction of eNavFit
    - To modernize the evaluation process, the Navy introduced **eNavFit** as a web-based interface bridging NAVFIT98A and future talent management systems.
    - Benefits were supposed to include:
        - Web-based routing and submission.
        - Real-time validation and error reduction.
        - Digital signatures and improved PII protections.
- 2023 – eNavFit Issues
    - After its introduction, eNavFit had enough widespread issues that Bureau of Naval Personnel issued **NAVADMIN 279/23**, authorizing continued use of NAVFIT98A through **31 December 2025**, citing ongoing development and enhancement needs for eNavFit.[^7]
- 2025 – eNavFit Scrapped, NAVFIT98A "Modernized"
    - [NAVADMIN 012/25](https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Messages/NAVADMIN/NAV2025/NAV25012.pdf?ver=XNxecwkcKmyF0dFjhYHpzA%3d%3d) anounced that it was officially scrapping eNavFit, and that "effective 1 May 2025, eNavFit will no longer be available for Fleet use"
    - On **July 30, 2025**, the Navy released **NAVFIT98A v2.2.0.33 (v33)**
    - New *CHIEFEVAL* evaluation format for chief petty officers aligned with guiding principles from the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.


The nickname “NAVFIT” has become part of Navy lore — a constant, seemingly immortal application stationed alongside sailors for decades. Despite ongoing efforts to modernize personnel systems, NAVFIT98A’s persistence underlines one of the Navy’s most enduring mantras: “If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it.”
