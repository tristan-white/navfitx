## History

#### üü¢ 1998 ‚Äì Origins: Birth of NAVFIT98

- NAVFIT98 was originally developed in **1998** to automate the performance evaluation process for sailors.
- It "replaced" paper-based forms with a Windows-based software for generating FitReps and Evals
    - It didn't fully eliminate the need to use phyical paper; "presently, there is no electronic system to submit performance evaluation reports" [^9]
- Early versions were rudimentary, but they **standardized the Navy‚Äôs evaluation process** for officers and enlisted personnel. ([Sea Stories and other lies][1])

#### üìà Early 2000s ‚Äì Adoption and Core Features

- NAVFIT98 became the **default evaluation tool** for the Navy, widely deployed across shore commands and ships.

    - Trait-based rating scales (1‚Äì5.0).
    - Summary group creation and ranking.
    - Bullet-based narrative comments.
    - Printing and mailing FitReps to Navy Personnel Command ([CocoDoc][2])

* Despite its age, it continued with relatively few feature additions, maintaining its basic design and reliance on Microsoft Access databases. ([Software Informer][3])

#### ü™© 2018 ‚Äì Commemorating 20 Years of NAVFIT98

* The U.S. Naval Institute marked the 20th anniversary of its debut on October 11, recognizing that **more than two decades later it still remained central** to naval personnel management, despite widespread calls for modernization. ([Reddit][4])

#### üîÑ 2010s ‚Äì Persistent Use and Frustration

* Despite the rise of electronic solutions and cloud-based software, NAVFIT98 continued unchanged, becoming a symbol of ‚Äúlegacy IT‚Äù in the Navy.
* Personnel often complained about its **clunky interface, single-workstation constraints, and manual distribution process**, even years after better technologies existed. ([Reddit][5])

#### üÜô 2022 ‚Äì Introduction of eNavFit

* To modernize the evaluation process, the Navy introduced **eNavFit** as a web-based interface bridging NAVFIT98A and future talent management systems.
* Benefits included:

  * Web-based routing and submission.
  * Real-time validation and error reduction.
  * Digital signatures and improved PII protections. ([DVIDS][6])

#### üõ†Ô∏è 2023 ‚Äì Continued Use Motion

* Bureau of Naval Personnel issued **NAVADMIN 279/23**, authorizing continued use of NAVFIT98A through **31 December 2025**, citing ongoing development and enhancement needs for eNavFit. ([Joel Schofer's Career Planning Blog][7])

#### üì¢ 2025 ‚Äì Major Update & v33 Release

#### üß≠ Present (2025 and Beyond)

* NAVFIT98A remains the **baseline tool for FitRep/Eval creation** across the fleet as of 2025.
* It continues to be phased into the Nautilus environment and hosted as part of the Navy‚Äôs core software suite.
* The Navy plans for future talent management modernization, with NAVFIT98A and eNavFit serving as transitional platforms.
